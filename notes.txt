-------------

All datatypes are object
we can use id() method to print the object address of the datatype variable passed.

inbuilt methods:
----------------
print()
type()
id()

int datatype:
long datatype is only available in python 2 and not in 3. We should use int datatype object/class only to represent in long.
there are 4 forms to reperesent int datatype
	- decimal (base 10 - this is default form - 0 to 9)
	- binary (base 2 - 0 and 1 - ex: a=0b1111 or a=0B1111 - 0b/0B prefixed - print(a) will give 15 - printing happens in decimal value - negative also handled -0B1111)
	- oct (base 8 - 0 to 7 - a=0o777 or a=0O777)
	- hexa (base 16 - 0 to 9, a to f or A to F - 0xFace or 0XFace) 

Note: for any form (binary, octal, hexa), python will give output only in decimal form
